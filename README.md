# SDP Benchmark Problems
In the following a set of benchmark problems is presented. These convex optimization problems all involve positive semidefinite constraints and occur in various fields, 
such as portfolio optimization, graph theory, robust control, or polynomial optimization. These problems were collected to benchmark conic solvers 
against each other and to study the performance gains of various extensions to our solver. The problems are in the following format:
```
min 1/2x'Px+q'x
s.t. Ax+s=b,
     s in K
```
with decision variables x in Rn, s in Rm and data matrices P=P'>=0, q in Rn, A in Rm√ón, and b in Rm. The convex cone K is a composition of the zero cone, 
the non-negative orthant, a set of second order cones, and a set of positive semidefinite cones. The following list gives an overview over the considered problems:
1. Nearest Correlation Matrix
2. Smallest Sphere around multiple Ellipsoids
3. LMI-based Robust Control Problems
4. Polynomial Sum-Of-Squares Problems
5. Semidefinite Relaxation of MIQO Problems
6. Lovasz Theta Function in Graph Theory
7. Random SDP with Quadratic Objective
8. (Maxcut problem in Graph Theory)
9. (Reducing Diagonal Dominance of a Kernel Matrix)
